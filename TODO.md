TODO List
=========

* Docker template
* Authentication for trees.
* Allowing trees to be stored in a database would be nice.
* Support HUP with state reset.
* Handle redirecting to folders without trailing slash to ones with a trailing slash
  so that relative URLs go to the right place.
* start-pixywerk:
  - Options for logging.
  - Options for gevent settings
  - Perhaps instead of using env var for config, pass config on command line (and generate from options) [curry do_werk with configs]

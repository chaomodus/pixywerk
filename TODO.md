TODO List
=========

* Need some sort of handler for directory templates.
  Ideally we'd be able to create a property file for the folder which would make it call a template that'd render the index for us, perhaps
  with default templates for rendcering Index Ofs.

* It'd be nice to be able to set default templates for file types / handler types.

* We already support search paths for templates, it'd be nice to be able to add to those down a tree, or have properties in general be inherited
  by lower objects.

* Proper logging would be good.

* Authentication for trees.

* Allowing content in bbcode, markdown and restructuredtext would be nice.

* Allowing trees to be stored in a database would be nice.
